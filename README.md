# Habitat
Unity VR Zero-G Habitat

The idea is simple, but the execution may not be.
I want to create a working VIRTUAL habitat.  It should be modular and expandable.  It is not, by itself, a game but may encompass some games.
It would be approachable on two levels: content creator - those who add to this project, and users - those who 'inhabit' this project.
The first basic module I envision is an office space.  Modules have interior and exterior, and this module should have a window.  Outside the window ...
depending on the habitat's deployment, a planetary object, deep space, whatever, as long as there is a sense of 'outside'. Other modules may be in view.
Inside this module, you can anchor yourself (stationary play workspace) and access VR content.  Work on your virtual desktop in space, or watch a video, or
chat with others.  This is pretty much what you can already do in the Oculus Quest 2 with the space station environment, but the added value is that you
can leave.  Bored with your office? Unanchor and move to another module.  Modules connect, so maybe visit another office and chat in VR with that user.
Or go to a communal area, which might be hosting group content.  With some planning, perhaps there could be purposed modules to allow gaming the environment,
such as a hydroponics area, or other systems that can be 'maintained' for resources (furnishings, possibly content access, thinking big...)

One thought is that this might make a good entry point for accessibility interface.  Sight and sound are the currently available haptics, but it's possible
that those impaired physically might be able to use VR to work and play even if their physical bodies are not capable.  These users might even enjoy having
a resting place and other facilites to virtually 'live' outside their limitations.

Another is that it might be possible to bring disparate gaming systems together.  This would require buy-in from the bigger markets (likely a pipe dream
unless this gets really popular), but imagine being able to access your console the same way you can currently access your PC, so that you can play on a
virtual large display even if you can't afford a large TV.  Possibly cable companies would like to make their content available in VR as well (there is slow
movement in that direction).

So I'm picturing a modular environment, growing in both virtual size and capabilities, including things I probably haven't thought of.  But let's start at
the beginning.  That first module is a working, but small office. It also has basic systems (air, environment, power) with connection interface for other
modules (including at least one door, of course). These virtual systems may not have any affect (not a misspelling) at first, but are there for possible
future use.  There should be room for widgets (furnishings and fixed interfaces).  The VR interface (hands) should reflect the environment, and the user
should also see a visor if exterior to the environment (in space).  Movement is stationary, so stick-based, as if with attitude jets.  That will be the
initial, rather boring, VR environment, until content can be added.

Assets will be needed (I'm no artist), and I will probably start with available assets from the Unity Asset Store, but I think I'd like to see assets made
specifically for this project and varied for deployment to user tastes (Clean, Industrial, Rusty and dark, or other design moods).

It's ambitious.  There are obstacles I see and probably others I don't.  But I intend to take the first steps in the journey of 1000 miles and see what
happens.
